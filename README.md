# BareLink

Made primarily with Twitter in mind, this app installs itself as a share destination for text. Just share to the app and it will try to strip all the unnecessary trackers from the link before copying it to your clipboard.

## Getting Started

This app is written with Xamarin, targetting only Android for now. You will need Visual Studio 2022 configured for Xamarin development, along with Android SDK and either an emulated device or an actual Android phone.

## Contributing

* We do not have the capacity to build an iOS version.
* More default filters might be nice!
* Any UI/UX feedback welcome.
